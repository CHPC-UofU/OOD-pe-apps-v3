  This app will launch a [MATLAB] GUI on [Redwood] or on a [Bristlecone node]. You will be able
  to interact with the MATLAB GUI through a VNC session.

  To start the job promptly, redwood-shared-short account and partition will be added in near future. 

  [GPU specification] is optional for the partitions that have them.
